<h1>My Anime Recommendation </h1>
<h2>3 Anime That You Should Watch!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Kingdom</h3>
<p>Classic war anime, but execute realistically with complex world building and execute excitingly on how the MC climb the ladder of that complex world to be the best general under the heaven</p>
<h3>AOT</h3>
<p>Unique anime at the time, it really execute the round-up emotion from tragedy-mystery combination</p>
<h3>One Puch Man</h3>
<p>Classic overpower movie, from zero to big zero, how the journey from unrecognizable to recognizable a bit and how Saitama acknowledged is a source of little bit satisfaction.</p>
